I am a software engineer with a proven ability to develop object oriented applications and big data technical innovations.

From 2015, I am pursuing my Master’s Degree of Information Technology in Carnegie Mellon University. As a self motivated fast learner, I had been involved in 10+ projects in fields of software development, cloud computing and E-commerce, including large-scale data analysis with cloud platform(AWS, Azure), RESTful web application development, system architecture design, requirement elicitation and technology law.

From 2012 to 2015, I had served as a software engineer intern for Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences(IECAS), where I have been repeatedly recognized for developing innovative solutions and customer-oriented software and systems. I was responsible for full lifecycle development of three GeoVis plugins(a GoogleEarth-like geo-info system), from initial requirement gathering to design, coding, testing, documentation and implementation. 

Known for practical data mining skills, I got my first Master’s Degree from IECAS, where I worked with Professor Yirong Wu in the field of data mining and NLP, and my dissertation is about “Study on Entity Linking Method for Microblogs”.

My technical expertise includes cross-platform proficiency (Windows, Unix and Linux); fluency in 10+ scripting/programming languages (including Java, C#, C, python, shell script, Javascript, SQL etc); and advanced knowledge of developer applications, tools(.Net, J2EE, SVN, Git…), methodologies and best practices (OOD, client/server…).
