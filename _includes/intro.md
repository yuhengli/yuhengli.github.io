Hi there, 

Welcome to my site! I am a coder, designer and snowboarder. I speak English and Chinese, but most of the time in `Java` and `Python`.

Currently I am a graduate student in the School of Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu), here I have been involed in many challanging [projects](/projects) on the cloud. Before this, I worked on data mining in the [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ie.cas.cn), my research fields includes [Text Mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining) and [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing). If you have any question or working opportunity, please feel free to [contact](mailto:yuhengli@cmu.edu) me.
